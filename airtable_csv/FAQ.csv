"What's the catch with the 'Free Homepage'?","There's no catch. I build you a high-quality, professional homepage to demonstrate my skills and earn your trust. If you love it, you can choose to upgrade to a full multi-page website. If not, there's absolutely no cost or obligation.",1
"Do I need to provide my own content and images?","For the free homepage, I'll use placeholder content and high-quality stock images if you don't have your own. For a full website project, I recommend providing your own content and photos to best represent your brand, but I can also help with copywriting and image sourcing as an additional service.",2
"What about a domain name and web hosting?","A domain name (e.g., yourbusiness.co.za) and web hosting are not included in the free homepage offer. When you decide to move forward with a full website, I can guide you through the process of purchasing them. They are essential for making your site live on the internet.",3
"How long does a full website take to build?","Once I have all your content, a 'Starter Site' typically takes 5-7 business days, and a 'Business Growth' site takes 7-14 business days. The timeline can vary depending on the complexity and the speed of feedback.",4
"What happens after my support period ends?","After your included support period, you can easily make simple text and image changes yourself. For peace of mind, I also offer affordable monthly website care plans that include hosting, security, backups, and ongoing support.",5
"Can you help with a logo and branding?","Absolutely! While not included in the standard website packages, I offer separate branding and logo design services to help create a cohesive and professional look for your business both online and offline.",6
