      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to provide my own content and images?",
        "answer": "For the free homepage, I'll use placeholder content and high-quality stock images if you don't have your own. For a full website project, I recommend providing your own content and photos to best represent your brand, but I can also help with copywriting and image sourcing as an additional service."

      {
        "question": "What about a domain name and web hosting?",
        "answer": "A domain name (e.g., yourbusiness.co.za) and web hosting are not included in the free homepage offer. When you decide to move forward with a full website, I can guide you through the process of purchasing them. They are essential for making your site live on the internet."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does a full website take to build?",
        "answer": "Once I have all your content, a 'Starter Site' typically takes 5-7 business days, and a 'Business Growth' site takes 7-14 business days. The timeline can vary depending on the complexity and the speed of feedback."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens after my support period ends?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can you help with a logo and branding?",
