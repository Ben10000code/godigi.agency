# godigi.agency - Free Homepage Lead Generation Site

This project is a modern, high-converting lead generation landing page for godigi.agency. It's built with React and Tailwind CSS to be fast, responsive, and easy to maintain.

The primary strategy is to offer a high-value, risk-free "Free Homepage" to attract small business clients, build trust, and then upsell to full website packages.

The website content is managed entirely through **Airtable**, acting as a headless CMS. This allows for instant content updates without changing any code.

### **Step 2: Get Your Airtable Credentials**

1.  **Find your Base ID:**
    - Go to [airtable.com/api](https://airtable.com/api).
    - Select the base you just created.
    - The Base ID starts with `app...` and is shown in the introduction section.

2.  **Generate a Personal Access Token (API Key):**
    - Go to your Airtable [developer hub](https://airtable.com/create/tokens).
    - Click "Create new token".
    - **Name:** Give it a name like "Godigi Agency Website".
    - **Scopes:** Add the `data.records:read` scope. This is crucial for security, as it only allows reading data.
    - **Access:** Select the base you created.
    - Click "Create token" and copy the key. **Save it somewhere safe.**

### **Step 3: Deploy to Vercel (or similar)**

1.  Push the project code to a GitHub/GitLab repository.
2.  Create a new project on Vercel and import the repository.
3.  **Add Environment Variables:**
    - In your Vercel project settings, go to "Environment Variables".
    - Add two variables:
      - `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID`: Paste the Base ID you copied.
      - `AIRTABLE_API_KEY`: Paste the Personal Access Token you created.
4.  Deploy! Your website should now be live and fetching content directly from your Airtable base.

### **Important: Image Optimization for Speed**

Before adding images to Airtable, **compress them**. Large images are the biggest cause of slow websites.

1.  **Compress:** Use a free online tool like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) to reduce file size.
2.  **Resize:** Resize images to be close to their final display size (e.g., 800px wide for portfolio images).
